The Scalabe Go Nostr Relay

Early days but have quite a component test coverage and basic tests
with Amethyst. Instance running live at relay.nostry.eu (not ready to be relied upon!)

Goals:

* Simple
* Correct
* Horizontally scalable
* Fast

In that order. I want to support as many NIPs as possible but only if
I can assure the above goals.

## NIPs support
