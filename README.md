Scalabe Go Nostr Relay

Right now it not fast nor really a nostr relay. Have not actually tested it with real client but should have NIP01 support if we belive the component tests.

Goals:

* Simple
* Correct
* Horizontally scalable
* Fast

In that order. I want to support as many NIPs as possible but only if I can assure the above goals.
